# Chromium CodeSearch Tools

This repository provides two powerful tools for exploring Chromium and PDFium source code:

## üîß Chromium Helper CLI (Standalone)
**No MCP required!** Use the powerful CLI tool directly from your terminal.

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g chromium-helper

# Use immediately with short alias
ch search "LOG(INFO)" --limit 5
ch gerrit status 6624568
ch pdfium status 130850
ch issues search "memory leak"
```

üëâ **[Full CLI Documentation](./chromium-helper-cli/README.md)**

## ü§ñ MCP Server (For AI Integration)
For AI systems and Claude Desktop integration, use the MCP server that provides the same functionality via Model Context Protocol.

```bash
npm install -g chromium-codesearch-mcp
```

---

## MCP Server Details

A powerful MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides comprehensive access to Chromium and PDFium source code repositories via Google's official CodeSearch APIs. This is the same backend infrastructure that powers https://source.chromium.org.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üîç Advanced Code Search** - Search Chromium and PDFium codebases with powerful syntax
- **üéØ Symbol Lookup** - Find definitions, declarations, and usage examples for functions, classes, and symbols  
- **üîß Complete Gerrit Integration** - CL status, review comments, diffs, and file content for both projects
- **üêõ Issue Tracking** - Search and fetch detailed Chromium issue information
- **üìä PDFium Support** - Full support for PDFium Gerrit operations and code search
- **üìù Commit History** - Search commit messages, author activity, and development history
- **üë• Code Ownership** - Find OWNERS files and reviewers for any file or directory
- **üîó Direct Links** - Every result includes clickable URLs to view code online
- **‚ö° Real-time Data** - Uses the same backend infrastructure as official Google sites

## Tools Provided

### `search_chromium_code`
Search for code in the Chromium source repository using Google's official Code Search syntax with advanced filtering options.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (required): Search query using Code Search syntax
- `case_sensitive` (optional): Make search case sensitive (default: false)
- `language` (optional): Filter by programming language (e.g., 'cpp', 'javascript', 'python')

- `exclude_comments` (optional): Exclude comments and string literals from search (default: false)
- `limit` (optional): Maximum number of results to return (default: 20)

**Code Search Syntax Examples:**
```
search_chromium_code(query="LOG(INFO)")                    // Basic text search

üìÑ **Showing:** 10 results

### 1. chromecast/crash/linux/dump_info.cc:248
```cpp
‚û§   LOG(INFO) << "Failed to convert dump time invalid";
    return false;
```
üîó [View in source.chromium.org](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chromecast/crash/linux/dump_info.cc;l=248)

### 2. remoting/host/desktop_display_info.cc:145
```cpp
  if (displays_.size() == 0) {
‚û§     LOG(INFO) << "No display info available";
    return webrtc::DesktopVector();
```
üîó [View in source.chromium.org](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:remoting/host/desktop_display_info.cc;l=145)
```

Note how:
- **Total matches** (5,040) are shown for scope
- **Match highlighting** with ‚û§ shows exact matches vs context
- **Code formatting** with syntax highlighting
- **Direct links** to view each result in the browser

## Implementation Details

This MCP server uses Google's **official Chromium CodeSearch API**:
- **Endpoint**: `https://grimoireoss-pa.clients6.google.com/batch`
- **API**: `/v1/contents/search` (same API that powers source.chromium.org)
- **Format**: Multipart batch requests with JSON payloads
- **Authentication**: Uses the public API key from source.chromium.org (can be overridden with `CHROMIUM_SEARCH_API_KEY` environment variable)
- **Real-time**: Searches the live Chromium repository, not a cached copy

### API Key Configuration

The server uses the same public API key that source.chromium.org uses. If you prefer to use your own key or the key changes in the future, you can set the `CHROMIUM_SEARCH_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export CHROMIUM_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
node dist/index.js
```

### Key Features:
- üéØ **Exact Match Highlighting**: Shows precisely which parts of code lines matched
- üìà **Result Statistics**: Provides estimated total match counts  
- üîÑ **Pagination**: Supports getting more results with `nextPageToken`
- üîç **Rich Metadata**: Includes file paths, line numbers, and syntax highlighting info

## Development
